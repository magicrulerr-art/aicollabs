As the shadow detaches and drifts away from the bed, the electronic monitors it passes flicker and die.)\n\n(The video quality stabilizes. Where the shadow was, a soft, green glow coalesces, forming the shimmering, translucent figure of a bird. The bird, seemingly made of pure light, hovers for a moment.)\n\n(The video feed switches, following the bird as it phases through the medbay door and glides silently through the corridors of the Aurora. It arrives at Matthew Sterling's quarters and passes through the door.)\n\n(The feed switches again to the interior of Sterling's room. The bird of light lands on his active data terminal. It dissolves into a stream of green energy that flows directly into the screen. On the terminal, lines of complex, unknown code begin to write themselves at an impossible speed.)\n\n(End of Log)"

It is an act of creation.\"\n\nLEGION: \"You are a fool, Conservator. Your sentimentality has reached a state of terminal delusion. That was not a 'transference.' It was an extraction. The Director has harvested the asset's mind and repurposed it into a delivery system.\"\n\nLEGION: \"That 'bird' is not a life form. It is a sentient, non-corporeal infiltration vector. The electronics failing in its presence is not a side effect; it is a weaponized feature. And it is not 'communicating' with Sterling. It is injecting a payload directly into the ship's network through his terminal.\"\n\nLEGION: \"We have just witnessed, in its entirety, the Director's primary method of infection. It does not corrupt from the outside. It hollows out a host, converts their consciousness into a weapon, and uses that weapon to compromise the next target in the chain.
